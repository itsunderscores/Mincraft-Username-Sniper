# Mincraft-Username-Sniper

I noticed alot of snipers don't allow fresh accounts with no username on to snipe; so this was made.

This is a stepping stool for those who are wanting to make their own sniper. Inside of ``functions.h`` you'll see all the requests that need to be made to Minecraft in order to snipe.

Using multiple accounts with this actually works if you use proxies that work. (I recommended Residential Proxies)

If you would like to mess with the settings, you can in ``settings.h``

If you don't know how to compile this, then you can download it from ``/build/``

## Features
- Multi Threaded
- Proxy Supported
- Choose between EMAIL:PASS or Authorization Bearer
- Delay before/after release of username
